Ramsey numbers are connected to a field of mathemathics called graph theory. Ramsey Number R(4,5) is defined as the smallest integer n, such that every graph of order n inculudes either a clique of order 4 or an independent set of order 5. This paper is based on results presented by Brendan D. McKay and Stanis≈Çaw P. Radziszowski. The goal was to recreate an experiment proving that R(4,5)=25, using modern technology and adapted algorithms. The thesis shows ways of creating a computer program that can be used for proving the mentioned equation, but does not present optimizations necessary for achieving a satisfactory execution time.
